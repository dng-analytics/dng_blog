<div id="box-office-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Box Office Data</h2>
<p>Obviously, we know that there isn’t much interest in going to the movies, and studios have limited their slate of movies, but we can think of the Box Office data as a heuristic for when people will feel comfortable going into indoor spaces again, post-covid.</p>
<p>For the week of Nov 6-12 the U.S. Box Office total was $13,088,160</p>

<p>U.S. spending data comes in at a bit of a lag, so the latest day we have data for is November 01. Spending is -6% below normal.</p>

<div id="spending-by-income-level" class="section level2">
<h2>Spending by Income Level</h2>
<p>Approximately 70% of US GDP is driven by consumer spending, and a lot of that consumer spending is normally driven by households in the highest income brackets. But we are seeing strong splits in terms of spending by income levels – as of November 01 spending by the highest income zip codes is still -9% below where it was prior to the pandemic.</p>
