<p>From <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-30/u-s-recovery-women-s-job-losses-will-hit-entire-economy" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pandemic is disproportionately affecting women and threatening to wipe out decades of their economic progress. As the crisis drags on, some of the biggest pain points are among women of color and those with young children.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]omen between the ages of 25 and 54 – also known as prime-age – are increasingly dropping out of the workforce, often to care for children. <strong>The participation gap between men and women in this age group is now widening</strong> after shrinking to the narrowest ever right before the virus.</p>

<h2>Wage Gap</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The female recession could slow the recovery, according to some economists and policy analysts. The wage gap will likely be more than 2 percentage points wider after a pandemic recession, instead of shrinking like it would during a normal downturn, according to Northwestern University economics professor Matthias Doepke, who co-authored a <a href="https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~mdo738/research/ADOT_0720.pdf" target="_blank">recent study</a> on the topic.</p>

<h2>Women Dropping Out</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Nearly 7 million Americans aren’t employed because they have to take care of children, according to a Census survey <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/hhp/hhp14.html" target="_blank">earlier this month.</a></p>
