<p>BLS has a new <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank">CPI report</a> noting the pretty remarkable price increases in used cars and trucks. This could be part of the reason why new cars are selling so well right now.</p>
<p>Below is a plot of the percentage change in CPI for used cars and trucks for the past decade. The used car market is bonkers right now. September saw a jump of 10.3%.</p>
