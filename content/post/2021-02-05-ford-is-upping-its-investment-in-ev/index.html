<p>Ford <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/ford-f-earnings-q4-2020.html" target="_blank">boosts investment</a> in electric and autonomous vehicles to $29 billion through 2025.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ford said its plans include $7 billion in self-driving vehicles and $22 billion in electrified vehicles, up from $11.5 billion through 2022. But not all the announced cash in EVs is new. The company is including previous investments of roughly $7 billion since 2016, bringing Fordâ€™s new investment commitment to $10.5 billion through 2025.</p>
