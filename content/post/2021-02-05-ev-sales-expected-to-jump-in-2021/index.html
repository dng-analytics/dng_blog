<p>From <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/report-71-jump-in-electric-vehicle-purchases-projected-for-2021/" target="_blank">Techrepublic</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic was responsible for slower EV commercial expansion, but 2020 still saw explosive sales across Europe and China, and an uptick in US sales,” Alison Alvarez, CEO of Blastpoint, said in a statement to TechRepublic. “In 2021 as charging infrastructure grows, businesses recover and restart their fleet electrification plans, and state and federal tax incentives return, the American EV industry is poised to flourish anew, fulfilling, and perhaps even exceeding, expectations for growth.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The study found that overall, more than 345,000 electric vehicles were sold in the United States in 2020 despite the economic downturn, far surpassing the 245,000 sold in 2019. There are now 1.5 million electric vehicles on US roads, up from 1.12 million in March 2019.</p>

<p>In terms of charging stations, the study found that 6,000 new stations were built in 2020 and 7,000 more were opened to the public compared to 2019.</p>
