From [Quartz](https://qz.com/1915737/instacart-is-surpassing-target-and-kroger-in-online-grocery-delivery/){target="_blank"}:

> A new report from the investment bank Cowen found that the food delivery company has surpassed Target and Kroger in popularity as a destination for online grocery orders. That puts Instacart, which started in 2012, right behind big retailers Walmart and Amazon.

### Online orders have remained high

> Even as many states have been easing lockdown measures, the Cowen report shows that in August, 32% of respondents indicated they had purchased groceries online, up from 18% the previous year.

### Instacart is pushing partnerships 

> Traditional grocers and retailers are generally not all that tech savvy. The need to swiftly set up systems for online ordering and home delivery in the pandemic provided Instacart the opportunity to expand its partnerships. It now offers delivery from more than 500 retailers such as Walmart, 7-Eleven, and Sephora, and delivers from 40,000 store locations across the US and Canada.
