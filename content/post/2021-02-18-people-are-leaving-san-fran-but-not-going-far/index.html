<blockquote>
<p>During an eight-month period between March and November shows that while the influx of new residents coming into the city remained constant between 2019 and 2020, the number of households leaving skyrocketed by more than 77%, or roughly 35,000 households — from 45,263 in 2019 to 80,371 in 2020.</p>

<p>But they’re not going to cheaper states like Texas or Florida, most are just capturing cheaper rents in adjoining areas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Enrico Moretti, an economist at UC Berkeley, said the out-migration is being driven by a combination of the high cost of living and perceived quality-of-life challenges. “There are cities that compete on price and cities that compete on quality,” he said. “When you look at the Bay Area, it doesn’t compete on price, and when you look at the quality of our public schools and how we manage public spaces — homelessness and crime — it’s not on par with what people pay to live here.”</p>
