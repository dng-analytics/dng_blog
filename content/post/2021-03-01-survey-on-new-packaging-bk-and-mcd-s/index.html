<p><a href="https://theharrispoll.com/mcdonalds-vs-burger-king-new-packaging-designs/" target="_blank">Harris Poll</a> recently fielded a survey on the packaging redesigns from McDonald’s and Burger King.</p>
<div id="some-results" class="section level4">
<h4>Some results:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Fifty-six percent of consumers said Burger King’s new packaging design made the food look more appetizing, and 54% said they prefer Burger King’s updated packaging when compared to McDonald’s</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Men especially took to Burger King’s new design, with 61% saying it makes the food look more appetizing, and 57% saying they prefer the Burger King’s new packaging vs. McDonald’s</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The impact on purchase consideration was most pronounced with consumers in the 35-44 age range, perhaps due to the retro and potentially nostalgic aesthetic of both designs. Two-thirds (66%) of consumers in this age range who preferred Burger King’s new packaging design said they’re more likely to buy its products. About the same number (62%) of consumers in the same age range who preferred McDonald’s new packaging said they’re more likely to buy from McDonald’s.</p>
