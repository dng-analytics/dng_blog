<p>From <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/electric-vehicle-charging-hub-to-park-itself-in-new-york-city-11612357206" target="_blank">WSJ</a> - Revel, the company best known for electric-moped sharing, says it is about to embark in a new direction by launching one of the largest hubs for quickly charging electric vehicles in New York City this spring.</p>
<p>Limited charging infrastructure is seen as an impediment to growth, especially in NYC where people often lack garages for overnight charging.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If New York City is going to push large-scale electrification somebody needs to be building the infrastructure and Revel is leading the charge,” said Frank Reig, Revel’s co-founder and chief executive.</p>
