<p>From <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/womens-labor-force-participation-rate-hit-33-year-low-in-january-2021.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The total number of women who have left the labor force since February 2020 to more than 2.3 million, and it puts women’s labor force participate rate at 57%, the lowest it’s been since 1988, according to NWLC.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of these women…have been forced to leave the workplace due to ongoing closures of schools and day care centers. These women, she explains, are not included in the calculated unemployment rate, which is already disproportionately high for women of color.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When broken down by race, White women saw an unemployment rate of 5.1% in January, while Asian women saw an unemployment rate of 7.9%, Black women saw an unemployment rate of 8.5% and Latinas saw an unemployment rate of 8.8%. The only group with an unemployment rate higher than Latinas is Black men, who in January, had an unemployment rate of 9.4%.</p>
