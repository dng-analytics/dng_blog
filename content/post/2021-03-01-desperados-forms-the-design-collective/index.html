<blockquote>
<p>The Desperados brand formed the Desperados Design Collective, comprising eight individuals of diverse backgrounds from different countries around the globe. Considering the effects of the global pandemic on creative industries, the Desperados Design Collective is a meaningful platform for on-the-rise artists. It provides a global platform for these talents to showcase their work while ushering in a new wave optimism and forward momentum for their respective fields â€” all while continuing to embed the beer brand into the culture at large.</p>
