summary: 'An ever growing group of people, myself included, are running around like headless chickens chasing ‘the new’ and ‘the shiny’. And we’re doing it all at speed. But during this race to progress, alongside the urgency for more, for better, when do we pause to ask ourselves ‘what are we doing and why?’'

<p>An interesting little thought piece arguing that we’re innovating at speed, and churning out work, simply for the sake of doing so. Instead, we need to pause and to really question the how and why of what we’re doing.</p>
<p>The piece highlights 4 different avenues of thought as to how to accomplish this slowing down.</p>
<p><a href="http://amorebeautifulquestion.com/" target="_blank">The Beginner’s Mindset</a> which involves seeing things from the perspective of someone who may not know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Questions-Are-Answer-Breakthrough-Approach-ebook/dp/B076H27PRJ" target="_blank">The Question Burst</a> which is a variation on the meeting brainstorm, which focuses on boosting questioning skills.</p>
<p>The Five Whys (no link), which involves asking the question why five times in a row as a way of getting deep into a problem</p>
<p>Negative Framing (no link) which involves admitting that things within a business are far from rosy.</p>
