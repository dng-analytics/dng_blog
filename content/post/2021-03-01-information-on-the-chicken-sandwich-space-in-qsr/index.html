<p>From <a href="https://www.qsrmagazine.com/fast-food/whos-really-winning-chicken-sandwich-wars" target="_blank">QSR Magazine</a> a pretty comprehensive overview of consumer demand for chicken sandwiches.</p>
<p>Some of the findings:</p>
<p>Look at the gains Popeye’s earned with its chicken sandwich (and how their gains came at the expense of all other brands), but note that Chick-fil-a is still pulling in 45% of the overall market share over the duration.<br />

<p>And from RMS, a survey in the first half of February on brand awareness and cravings of chicken sandwiches. Chick-fil-a wins on customer awareness and craving despite having a limited footprint. But honestly, look at the room to play in the craving category. Only 30% crave Chick-fil-a despite 75% awareness.</p>

<p>Some other results reported here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More than 70 percent of respondents said they believe a chicken sandwich should be priced lower than a beef burger</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Only 51 percent said they buy chicken as a more affordable option</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>46 percent believe chicken is better value than beef</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As QSR notes, this should highlight the price sensitivity that customers have with chicken sandwiches. They don’t find them nearly as indulgent as beef.</p>
