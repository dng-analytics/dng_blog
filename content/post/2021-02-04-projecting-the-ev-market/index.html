<p>Just how many EVs are going to be produced over the next several years. <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-ev-industry-has-giant-goals-how-it-all-stacks-up-51612443600" target="_blank">Barron’s</a> is trying do some of the math.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General Motors has its target for 2035. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has talked about selling 20 million EVs by 2030 and plans to increase its production volume at 50% a year for the foreseeable future. Volkswagen wants up to 25% of vehicle sales to come from battery-powered electric vehicles by 2030. And Toyota plans to sell 5.5 million electrified vehicles by 2030—a figure that includes hybrid electric cars as well as fuel-cell vehicles.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We calculate that, based on company comments, somewhere between 15 million and 20 million EVs will be sold a year by 2025. That implies an average annual growth rate of about 50% between last year and then. With that growth, EVs would account for roughly 15% to 20% of total light-vehicle sales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s worldwide, but still it’s pretty staggering growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wedbush analyst Dan Ives qualifies as an electric-vehicle bull, but his estimate of EVs’ share of the market isn’t that high. “I am laser focused on the skyrocketing EV demand out of China, Biden green initiatives, and [battery innovation] across the EV supply chain,” he tells Barron’s. “It looks like a golden age for EVs.” Still, he is assuming EVs will win about 10% of the global market by 2025.</p>
