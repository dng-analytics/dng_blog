According [to CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/13/media/amc-theatres-money-movies/index.html){target="_blank"}, AMC Theaters is saying it may run out of money by the end of 2020. 

## People aren't going to theaters even when open 

> As of October 9, AMC reopened 494 of its nearly 600 US theaters at a seating capacity between 20% and 40%. But AMC (AMC) isn't filling the limited seats it's offering: Since the US theatrical market reopened in the late summer, it has served more than 2.2 million guests. **That represents an attendance decline of 85% compared to last year.**

## The slate of movies is small and moving to VOD

> Films like Marvel's "Black Widow" and the new James Bond title "No Time to Die" have been pushed to next year while Pixar's "Soul" has been pulled from theaters entirely to debut on Disney's streaming service, Disney+.
