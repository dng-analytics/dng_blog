<p>The Black Catalog was launched by Black employees at Mullen Lowe. The <a href="https://www.the-black-catalog.com" target="_blank">website</a>, aside from offering products from Black owned companies, raises interesting questions about the corporate response to the racial issues that were triggered over the past year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Black people know how to organize in crisis we have always had to advocate for ourselves….This moment is not new for us, but the cultural context shifts in corporate spaces. Black folks can organize, but not all black people are or want to be organizers. On top of that, most Black folks are tasked with the work of organizing in addition to their job, and transforming corporate practices in predominantly non-black spaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What are we doing to prepare Black employees for moments of leadership beyond hyper visible moments of crisis? Black people need breathing room – time and space to pour into ourselves. Employers need to invest in moments of creative autonomy.</p>
