<p>Gavin Newsom’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/06/newsom-plan-includes-1point5-billion-to-boost-electric-hydrogen-vehicles.html" target="_blank">proposed budget</a> for CA has some large earmarks for EV sales and infrastructure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 2021 proposal, which Newsom previewed on Tuesday, includes $1.5 billion earmarked to help people and businesses purchase electric or hydrogen vehicles and equipment, and to invest in construction and maintenance of charging and fueling infrastructure, which would be needed to support expanded use of these vehicles in the state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Newsom’s proposal also dedicates $300 million to maintenance and “greening” of state infrastructure, and would allow installation of electric vehicle charging stations at all state-owned facilities. That could include charging stations from the likes of Tesla, ChargePoint, Electrify America (part of the Volkswagen Group) and Volta Charging.</p>
<p>In 2020, Newsom signed an order banning sales of new internal combustion engine vehicles in California by 2035. Automakers are working to provide more offering to customers. “According to AutoForecast Solutions Vice President of Global Vehicle Forecasting, Sam Fiorani, in the next year alone, eleven new North American-built electric vehicles are expected to enter the domestic market, along with an updated Tesla Model S.”</p>
