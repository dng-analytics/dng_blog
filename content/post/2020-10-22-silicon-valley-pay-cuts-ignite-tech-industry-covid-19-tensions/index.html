<p>From the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-pay-cuts-ignite-tech-industry-covid-19-tensions-11602435601" target="_blank">WSJ</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tech workers fleeing the San Francisco Bay Area to work remotely amid the pandemic are facing a new reality: pay cuts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past several months, Covid-19 has shaken traditional notions of where employees can work. In Silicon Valley, which has a relatively high cost of living and an employee base with access to state-of-the-art remote-work tools, companies are devising plans for a future with decentralized staffs. In some cases, changes can include cutting salaries by 15% or more depending on where someone moves.</p>
